> A collective of public relations agencies best known for supporting tech clients like OpenAI, Coinbase, Google, and Amazon is looking to revolutionize industry standards by ditching empty impression metrics for hard readership numbers instead.  

## Why It Matters
PR professionals have long relied on metrics that do little to show the true impact, reach, and value of earned media. Understanding the reach and value of traditional media placements has become more important given the rise of social media news influencers, digital creators, and podcasters.

Delve, Marker Collective’s intelligent insight engine, now includes readership data on all projects, providing precise, actionable metrics to transform how brands measure media impact.
