*Sam Whitmore's Media Survey (SWMS)* typically avoids covering the business initiatives of its subscribers, but the launch of Marker Collective’s coverage measurement tool, Delve, stands out as a revealing development. Here’s what we know about this new venture.

### Marker Collective’s Delve Launch
Marker Collective, the parent organization of PR agencies Archetype, Nectar, and OutCast, launched Delve last month as a coverage measurement tool. According to Marker Collective CEO Helena Maus, Delve is primarily designed for internal use but is also being marketed to “advisors, companies, and other agencies.”

Delve aggregates articles and analyzes them for sentiment and the effectiveness of key message pull-through. Its primary goal is to automate the grunt work of coverage tracking, allowing teams to focus on strategic questions like “where do we go from here?”

### Development and Sales Approach
Currently, Delve does not have a dedicated sales team. Marker Collective Chief Product Officer Andrew Wyatt is leading the bootstrapping efforts. In an email, Andrew shared, “It’s honestly really fun when you can get direct feedback from a prospective customer and then talk about it same day in your product prioritization meeting.” This hands-on approach highlights the flexibility of Delve’s early development phase.

### Pricing and Consulting
Delve offers tiered pricing plans to accommodate different needs:
- **$4,000 per month**: Track up to 2,500 articles.
- **$7,000 per month**: Track up to 2,500 articles plus 15 consulting hours to interpret findings and suggest strategies.
- **$12,000 per month**: Track up to 7,000 articles plus 40 consulting hours of consulting support.

Marker Collective recognizes that customers might lack the time or inclination to fully master a new tool. The inclusion of consulting services reflects an integrated approach of software plus services, designed to maximize value for users.

### Market Context and Future Potential
This software-plus-services model could resonate in an era where C-suite executives pressure short-staffed in-house communications teams to deliver data-driven insights rather than opinions. However, Delve faces competition: the Prowly blog lists over 30 media monitoring products, and many PR agencies already use internally developed tools. With tens of thousands of PR agencies worldwide (according to GPT-4o), Delve’s success will depend on its ability to stand out.

Software scales efficiently, while services do not. It will be intriguing to observe how Marker Collective leverages Delve’s technology to future-proof its business in the competitive PR landscape.

### Conclusion
Marker Collective’s launch of Delve signals a strategic bet on software to enhance its offerings, blending AI-driven tools with consulting services. As the PR industry evolves, Delve’s ability to deliver actionable insights and scale effectively could position Marker Collective as a leader in coverage measurement and strategic communications.
