## How does Delve organize its structure?

- **Projects**: Within a workspace, projects can represent a company, business unit, or industry, allowing focused tracking and analysis.
- **Trackers**: Projects include up to five trackers (Primary, Competitor, Industry, Customer, Partner), each with an inbox where coverage flows in based on predefined searches. You can specify competitors and priority publications at the project level.

## How do I manage coverage in Delve’s Trackers?
Within a Tracker’s inbox, you can perform the following actions:
- **Track (T)**: Move relevant coverage into your tracker to trigger analysis and save it for reporting.
- **Archive (A)**: Remove irrelevant coverage from the inbox but keep it available in the archive for future reference.
- **Open Link (O)**: View the full article to decide whether to track it.
- **Add Label (L)**: Apply labels to organize coverage, such as daily flags or tracking specific launches or themes.

## How does Delve pull in coverage?
Delve leverages a variety of trusted data partners to ensure comprehensive, up-to-date coverage.

These integrations ensure Delve continuously provides timely and accurate coverage data for your projects and trackers.

## Does Delve have access to paywalled content?
Access to paywalled content depends on the publisher. Delve is working to expand access to more paywalled sources over time. If paywalled content appears in your inbox but analysis isn’t available, you can manually paste the full text into the article’s side panel after tracking it to enable analysis.

## How do I import coverage into Delve?
If coverage isn’t appearing in your inbox but should be, use the “Import” button at the top of the inbox or tracker. This feature pulls in the coverage and automatically runs analysis, ensuring you capture all relevant data.

## What metadata does Delve provide when I track coverage?
When you track a piece of coverage, Delve provides rich, actionable metadata across ten categories:

   - **Why it Matters**: Explains the article’s significance for the industry, company, or tracked subject (e.g., “Significant AI advancements impacting the competitive landscape”).
   - **New Developments**: Highlights any new or significant updates (e.g., “Apple’s beta OS introduces AI enhancements”).
   - **Takeaway**: Key conclusions or insights (e.g., “Apple’s AI push marks a strategic move in the tech race”).

3. **Quotes**:
   - Notable statements from key figures, categorized as:
     - Author Statement: Insightful comments by the article’s author.
     - Company Statement: Official responses or comments from the company.
     - Third-Party Expert: Opinions from industry analysts or experts.

5. **Topic Mentions & Sentiment**:
   - Tracks mentions and sentiment for subjects defined in tracker settings.
   - **Mentions**: Number of times a topic or subject is mentioned.
   - **Sentiment**: Assesses the article’s tone on a 0-1 scale:
     - Negative

     - Neutral
     - Somewhat positive
     - Positive

6. **Key Messages Analysis**:
   - Analyzes tracked key messages within coverage, including:
     - Message: The specific message being tracked.
     - Mention Count: How often the message appears.
     - *Note*: Delve uses semantic analysis to capture the meaning and essence of messages, not just verbatim matches.

7. **Competitor Mentions**:

     - Number of mentions.
     - Average sentiment across mentions, using the same 0-1 scale.

8. **Predefined Themes**:

     - And over 600 additional themes (e.g., “3D Printing,” “AgTech,” “Blockchain,” “Electric Vehicles,” “Generative AI”—see full list in Delve’s documentation or contact support for details).

9. **Readership**:
   - Provides unique readership data directly from publishers’ analytics for over 1,700 publications. This metric is more accurate than traditional Unique Visitor Metrics (UVM) or Reach data, though it may show lower numbers. We recommend discussing this shift with stakeholders before adopting it for reporting.

10. **Measurement**:
    - Includes share of voice and share of mention metrics to evaluate media presence:
      - **Share of Voice**: Measures whether a subject or competitor is mentioned at least once in an article, assigning one point per mention per article.
        - *Example*: 
          - Article 1: Google mentioned 2 times, Microsoft not mentioned → Google: 1 point, Microsoft: 0 points.
          - Article 2: Google mentioned 1 time, Microsoft mentioned 1 time → Google: 1 point, Microsoft: 1 point.
          - Article 3: Google mentioned 10 times, Microsoft mentioned 1 time → Google: 1 point, Microsoft: 1 point.
          - *Calculation*: Google: 3 points, Microsoft: 2 points. Total: 5 points.
          - *Result*: Google: 60% share of voice, Microsoft: 40% share of voice.
      - **Share of Mentions**: Counts the actual number of mentions for subjects or competitors across articles.
        - *Example*: 
          - Article 1: Google (2 mentions), Microsoft (0 mentions).
          - Article 2: Google (1 mention), Microsoft (1 mention).
          - Article 3: Google (10 mentions), Microsoft (1 mention).
          - *Calculation*: Google: 13 total mentions, Microsoft: 2 total mentions. Total: 15 mentions.
          - *Result*: Google: 86.67% share of mentions, Microsoft: 13.33% share of mentions.

## Can the metadata Delve provides be customized?
Currently, Delve’s metadata cannot be customized, but we’re continuously enhancing it to be as comprehensive as possible. For example, we’ve replaced traditional Unique Visitor Metrics (UVM) with “Readership,” which offers far more accurate and insightful data for your analysis.

   - We recommend assigning a rotating team to maintain “inbox zero” daily for optimal efficiency.

## What happens if competitive coverage comes from someone not listed as a competitor?
If an unlisted competitor (e.g., “ACME Co.”) releases relevant coverage, you can temporarily track it by:
1. Adding the competitor to your Competitor List in the project settings temporarily.
2. Manually importing relevant coverage into the Competitor Tracker using the import feature.
3. Adding a label to tag all related coverage (e.g., the competitor’s name or launch event).
4. Creating a report filtered by that label to focus on the temporary competitor’s coverage.

## How are the dashboard figures calculated in Delve?
Delve’s dashboard calculates key metrics based on all tracked and summarized articles within a project for the selected date range. Here’s how each metric is determined:

- **Key Numbers**:
  - **Coverage Volume**: Counts the number of articles from the primary tracker in the total dataset.
  - **Mentions**: Sums all mentions of subjects or entities from the tracked articles.
  - **Readership**: Aggregates readership numbers from the tracked articles, based on publisher analytics.

- **Coverage Over Time**:
  - Uses all articles in the date range (primary, competitor, and industry trackers).
  - Each article mentioning an entity (subject or competitor) counts as one piece of coverage.
  - *Example*: If an article mentions Komatsu (1 mention), John Deere (3 mentions), and Caterpillar (2 mentions), each entity is counted once in the coverage volume.

- **Share of Voice (SoV)**:
  - Uses all articles in the dataset.
  - Assigns one point per entity per article if mentioned at least once.
  - *Example*: If an article mentions Komatsu, John Deere, and Caterpillar, each gets 1 point (total 3 points).
  - *Calculation*: If Komatsu, John Deere, and Caterpillar each appear in multiple articles, their points are totaled, and SoV is calculated as a percentage (e.g., Komatsu 33%, John Deere 33%, Caterpillar 33%).

- **Share of Mentions**:
  - Uses all articles in the dataset.
  - Counts every mention of an entity within articles.
  - *Example*: If an article includes Komatsu (1 mention), John Deere (3 mentions), and Caterpillar (2 mentions), total mentions are 6.
  - *Calculation*: Komatsu 16%, John Deere 50%, Caterpillar 34%.

- **Sentiment Analysis**:
  - Uses all articles in the dataset.
  - Assigns a sentiment score for the subject and competitors, categorized as:
    - Positive (0.69–1)
    - Somewhat positive (0.55–0.689)
    - Neutral (0.45–0.549)
    - Somewhat negative (0.31–0.449)
    - Negative (0–0.309)

- **Topics & Key Messages**:
  - Focuses on topics and key messages from the primary tracker.
  - **Mentions Mode**: Shows the number of articles mentioning a topic or key message at least once.
  - **Percentage Mode**: Uses coverage volume as the denominator to calculate the percentage of articles mentioning a topic or message.

*Note*: The “total dataset” includes articles from the primary tracker (total count), plus competitor and industry trackers (counting mentions of competitors or the subject company).
